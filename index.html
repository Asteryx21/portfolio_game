                    As an intern with the LCI lab of the Computer Science Department, 
                    I worked on the <a href="https://surroundedby.science/" target="_blank">Surrounded by Science</a> project ,
                    which aims to increase kids' engagement with science. 
                    My primary responsibility was to re-design and develop the front end of the Science Chaser web app.

                    I collaborated closely with a team from the lab, and we were in regular communication with the University of Twente team, who were responsible for the backend development and project coordination. 
                    Our team had a strict deadline to complete the web app by the start of January 2023, as it was scheduled to be tested in a museum in Italy.
                        
                    Throughout the project, I gained valuable experience in front-end development and working collaboratively with a team. 
                    It was also exciting to work on a project with such a significant real-world application, as the web app has the potential to increase kids' awareness and engagement with science.

                    In this study, a serious game called “Galaxy Solutions” was developed. 
                    This game simulates all the stages of the recruitment process. 
                    The main objective of this game is to help graduates acquire basic interview skills and be aware of the whole process by making the learning experience more enjoyable and engaging. 
                    The game was evaluated by 105 students, and it was found usable by all the students, regardless of their success level in the game, and had a statistically significant learning effect, as the pre-posttest analysis revealed.
